# LLaMA-LoRA Implementation

This repository provides a professional and efficient implementation of **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)** applied to **LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI)** models. The primary goal is to enhance training efficiency and reduce memory usage without compromising performance, making it ideal for fine-tuning large-scale models with limited resources.

## 🌟 Features
- ✅ **Efficient Training:** Integrates LoRA to reduce computational overhead and memory requirements.
- ✅ **Memory Optimization:** Allows training larger models with reduced GPU memory consumption.
- ✅ **Scalability:** Easily adaptable to various LLaMA models.
- ✅ **Plug-and-Play Architecture:** Simple integration with pre-existing models.
- ✅ **Interactive Training Notebook:** Seamless training experimentation with Jupyter notebooks.

## 📦 Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/LLaMA-LoRA-Implementation.git
cd LLaMA-LoRA-Implementation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install required packages:
```bash
pip install torch transformers accelerate peft matplotlib
```

## 🚀 Training the Model
You can train the model using the command line or the interactive notebook.

### Using Command Line
```bash
python train.py
```

### Using Jupyter Notebook
Open `training.ipynb` and follow the steps to train and evaluate the model interactively.

## 📌 Inference Example
To load the trained model and generate text, use the following code snippet:
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
from train import load_model_for_inference

model_path = './lora-llama-final'
model, tokenizer = load_model_for_inference(model_path)

prompt = "Hello, I'm Dawood M D. How are you?"
generated_text = generate_text(model, tokenizer, prompt)
print("Generated Text:\n", generated_text)
```
