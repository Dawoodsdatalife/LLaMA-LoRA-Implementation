# LLaMA-LoRA Implementation

This repository provides a professional and efficient implementation of **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)** applied to **LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI)** models. The primary goal is to enhance training efficiency and reduce memory usage without compromising performance, making it ideal for fine-tuning large-scale models with limited resources.

## 🌟 Features
- ✅ **Efficient Training:** Integrates LoRA to reduce computational overhead and memory requirements.
- ✅ **Memory Optimization:** Allows training larger models with reduced GPU memory consumption.
- ✅ **Scalability:** Easily adaptable to various LLaMA models.
- ✅ **Plug-and-Play Architecture:** Simple integration with pre-existing models.

## 📦 Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/LLaMA-LoRA-Implementation.git
cd LLaMA-LoRA-Implementation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install required packages:

pip install torch transformers accelerate
```

## 🚀 Usage
Here's an example of training the model using LoRA:
```bash
python train.py
```

## 📌 Example Usage
```python
from lora_model import LLaMAWithLoRA
from transformers import LlamaTokenizer

model_name = "llama-base"
tokenizer = LlamaTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = LLaMAWithLoRA(model_name)

text = "Hello, I am Dawood M D. Wecome to by GitHub"
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)
print(outputs)
```
